        <h1>Hello, my name is Nikolay Kryachko!</h1>
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting my website. First, I'll tell you about myself.
            My name is <span class="highlight">Nikolay</span>, I live in
            <span class="highlight">St. Petersburg</span> and I have been programming for more than 3.5 years.
            It all started with the fact that one day I entered the 
            <span class="highlight">Lyceum of the Yandex Academy</span> and started learning Python.
            Since then, my journey in the IT industry has begun. I also participated in many 
            <span class="highlight">Olympiads</span> in mathematics and computer science (which allowed me to go to university), 
            but more on that later...
        </p>
