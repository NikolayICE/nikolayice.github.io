            Hello, my name is
            <span class="colored">Nikolay Kryachko!</span>
        </h1>
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting my website. First, I'll tell you a little bit about
            myself. My name is <span class="colored">Nikolay</span>, I live in
            <span class="colored">St. Petersburg</span> and have been programming for more
            than 3.5 years. It all started when I enrolled at the
            <span class="marker">Yandex Academy</span> and started learning
            <span class="colored">Python</span>. Since then, my career in the
            <span class="colored">IT</span> industry has begun. During this time, I have
            gained extensive experience in <span class="colored">C++</span> programming,
            <span class="marker">machine learning and data analysis</span> in
            <span class="colored">Python</span>, working with APIs and application
            containerization. I also participated in many <span class="marker">Olympiads</span> in
            mathematics and computer science (which allowed me to go to university), but more on that later...

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I really <span class="colored">enjoy</span> learning new things and developing. I
            <span class="colored">like</span> to read technical literature and study new
            technologies. I often attend events and <span class="marker">meetups</span> to gain
            knowledge and experience from professionals in my field. As mentioned earlier, my
            path to <span class="colored">IT</span> began with learning Python. Later, I mastered
            new <span class="colored">technologies</span> and programming languages (and I continue
            to do this every day now). At school, I was interested in science
            <span class="marker">Olympiads</span>. Here are some of my achievements:

            To put it in a little more detail, the National Technology Olympiad is applied
            in nature. In business process automation, I needed to
            <span class="colored">create an application</span> for a specific business. The
            result is a system for accounting and automation of routine tasks. And at the
            artificial intelligence finals, I was working on
            <span class="colored">creating an algorithm</span> that predicts the properties
            of a substance based on its chemical formula.

        <p>
            I have many projects in <span class="colored">C++</span>, for example, a route search
            application implemented using the Yandex Timetable API, writing my own data type, and
            creating images encoded in <span class="colored">BMP</span> format. I know the STL
            library and <span class="colored">algorithms</span> well, and I work in
            <span class="colored">C++17</span> or <span class="colored">C++20</span>. In
            <span class="colored">Python</span>, I developed
            <span class="marker">machine learning</span> models using libraries and frameworks
            (<span class="marker">PyTorch</span>, <span class="marker">scikit-learn</span>,
            <span class="marker">TensorFlow</span>, <span class="marker">CatBoost</span>, and others), created Telegram
            bots and
            games for myself.

            <span class="colored">Experience</span>: I worked for Minerday for 10 months. My responsibilities
            included maintaining and updating the corporate website and working with databases. My technology stack is
