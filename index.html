        <h1>Hello, my name is Nikolay Kryachko!</h1>
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting my website. First, I'll tell you about myself.
            My name is <span class="highlight">Nikolay</span>, I live in
            <span class="highlight">St. Petersburg</span> and I have been programming for more than 3.5 years.
            It all started with the fact that one day I entered the 
            <span class="highlight">Lyceum of the Yandex Academy</span> and started learning Python.
            Since then, my journey in the IT industry has begun. I also participated in many 
            <span class="highlight">Olympiads</span> in mathematics and computer science (which allowed me to go to university), 
            but more on that later...
        </p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I want to say that I really enjoy learning something new and developing. I really like to read technical literature, news, and new technologies, and I often go to various meetings and events to gain knowledge and experience from professionals in my field. 
            As I wrote earlier, my path to IT began with learning Python. Later, I mastered new technologies and programming languages (and I still continue to do so). 
            At school, I was interested in Olympiads in exact sciences. I will list some achievements:
        </p>
        <ul class="achievements-list">
            <li>The winner of the National Technological Olympiad on Business Process Automation</li>
            <li>The winner of the ITMO University Olympiad in Mathematics</li>
            <li>The participant of the final stage of the All-Russian Olympiad in Economics</li>
            <li>The participant of the final stage of the National Technological Olympiad on Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>The participant of many hackathons (e.g., "Вездекод from VK", "VTB API Hack", "Цифровой прорыв" and others)</li>
        </ul>
