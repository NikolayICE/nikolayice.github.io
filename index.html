    <h1>Hello, my name is Nikolay Kryachko!</h1>
    <p>
      Thank you for visiting my website. First, I'll tell you about myself.
      My name is <span class="highlight">Nikolay</span>, I live in
      <span class="highlight">St. Petersburg</span> and I have been programming for more than 3.5 years.
      It all started when I entered the 
      <span class="highlight">Lyceum of the Yandex Academy</span> and started learning Python.
      Since then, my journey in the IT industry has begun. I also participated in many 
      <span class="highlight">Olympiads</span> in mathematics and computer science (which allowed me to go to university), 
      but more on that later...

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I really enjoy learning something new and developing. I love reading technical literature, news, and exploring new technologies.
      I often attend meetings and events to gain knowledge and experience from professionals in my field.
      As mentioned earlier, my path to IT began with learning Python. Later, I mastered new technologies and programming languages (and I continue to do so).
      At school, I was interested in Olympiads in exact sciences. Here are some of my achievements:

    <ul class="achievements-list">
      <li>The winner of the National Technological Olympiad on Business Process Automation</li>
      <li>The winner of the ITMO University Olympiad in Mathematics</li>
      <li>The participant of the final stage of the All-Russian Olympiad in Economics</li>
      <li>The participant of the final stage of the National Technological Olympiad on Artificial Intelligence</li>
      <li>The participant of many hackathons (e.g., "Вездекод from VK", "VTB API Hack", "Цифровой прорыв" and others)</li>
    </ul>
